## About

Personal configuration files for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
I've had this stuff around since 2014~2015.

This repo should be cloned inside `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive/csgo/cfg`.

My stuff is under the directory `user/` to avoid polluting the default
directory.

## Notable scripts

- `fws.cfg`: script for switching weapons.
- `multidimensional_buybinds.cfg`: script for having layered buy binds on the
  numpad.
